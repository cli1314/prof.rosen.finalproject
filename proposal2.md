# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO: For the website, I work in a family resturant and I'm thinking of making a website
for it so "Gold House" would be the title.
      For the game, I have a small goal: to be able to create a mmorpg someday but
I'm not sure if that's possible yet so a small game as a step first. Depending on the 
game, I'll proably name it something closer to the game such as for a snake game, I'll
name it uh... "Chomp,Chomp,Chomp"? I'm bad at naming anything.
      I took a HTML course once so I'll probably be more confident in the website 
project so I'm more likely be leaning more toward making a website now.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO: A simple website like an online menu. 
      A interactive game?

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO: Nothing too complicated. Just a site map with home page, menu titles, location.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD/BETTER/BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO: I hope the website will have:
      Readable/Understable Text
      Will be Easy to Navigate
      Just overall not too boring
      If my mom would allow, I really want to try online ordering but a lot of customers
      get our name wrong with a neighboring resturant with almost the exact same name
      so that'll be too much to ask for.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO: Well, I'm not going to aim that high but I learned HTML5 before, perhaps it'll 
      be like that but I guess all I need to learn and pay attention to is how to build
      a website with python. 
      
A, maybe irrelevant, question: I learned to build a snake game with curses, I was just
wondering if I wanted to create a game, do I have to use a specific program such as love.
